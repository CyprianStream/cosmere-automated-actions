# Cosmere Automated Actions
A module to add automations to the CosmereRPG system for FoundryVTT

## Features
This module will add in automations to some basic actions and items

Current automated items include:
- Breathe Stormlight
- Enhance
- From The Brink(in testing)
- Stormlight Reclamation(only adds 1 for now)

## Requirements
To use this module you MUST have the following modules installed

- [libWrapper](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/lib-wrapper)

It is also recommended to have the following paid modules to get the most value out of this module, but it will work with just the base starter rules as well.

- [Cosmere RPG Stormlight Worldguide](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/cosmere-rpg-stormlight-worldguide)

## Planned Features
I will be slowly adding automations to features as I have need for them, or feel free to request them in the issue tracker!
Current items planned for automation include:
- Aid
- Stormlight Reclamation(Add popup that lets you pick how much to add)
- Explosive Growth
- Injury Regrowth
- Progression
