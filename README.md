# Cosmere Automated Actions
A module to add automations to the CosmereRPG system for FoundryVTT

## Features
This module will add in automations to some basic actions and items

Current automated items include:
- Breathe Stormlight
- Enhance
- From The Brink
- Stormlight Reclamation
- Illumination
- Progression
- Injury Regrowth
- Disquiet

## Requirements
It is recommended to have the following paid modules to get the most value out of this module, but it will work with just the base starter rules as well.

- [Cosmere RPG Stormlight Handbook](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/cosmere-rpg-stormlight-handbook)
- [Cosmere RPG Stormlight Worldguide](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/cosmere-rpg-stormlight-worldguide)

## Planned Features
I will be slowly adding automations to features as I have need for them, or feel free to request them in the issue tracker!
Current items planned for automation include:

- Explosive Growth
- Gravitation
- Gravitational Slam
- Mighty

Items on this list may not be added in any particular order, if you would like an item added let me know, or add it yourself by submitting a PR with the macro!


## Need help?
Open an issue and I'll get to it when I can, unfortunately since this is a side project progress may be slow
